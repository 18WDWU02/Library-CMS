His life changes on the day of his eleventh birthday when he receives a letter of acceptance into a Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardrydelivered by a half-giant named Rubeus Hagrid after previous letters had been destroyed by Harryâ€™s Uncle Vernon and his Aunt Petunia. Hagrid explains Harry's hidden past as the wizard son of James and Lily Potter, who were a wizard and witch respectively, and how they were murdered by the most evil and powerful dark wizard of all time, Lord Voldemort, which resulted in the one-year-old Harry being sent to live with his aunt and uncle. The strangest bit of the murder was how Voldemor was unable to kill him, but instead had his own powers removed and blasted away, sparking Harry's immense fame among the magical community</textarea>
